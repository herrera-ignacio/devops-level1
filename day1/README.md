* Focus on harder problems
* Holistic delivery process, faster and better

### Team Settings

#### Traditional

* Emphasis on titles
* Shaodw responsibilities

#### Agile

* One team approach
* Operations often acts or gets treated as a silo
	* Tasked with deliverables
	* Outside of Agile frameworks
	* Often receives non-functional requirement after Development
* Blame game
* Obstacles to collaboration, processes and tools that are built up in front of Operations.
* Operations perceived as bottleneck.
* High-frequency of software only on development

### Building blocks of DevOps

#### Measurements and Metrics

* You can only improve if you measure
* Traditional approach
* Agile approach

#### Improve Flow of Features

* Fast feedback (from inception to availability)
* Decreasing risk of releases through a holistic approach
* Reduce batch size without changing capacity

#### Improve and Accelerate Delivery

* Small releases over big releases
* Deploy frequently, reduce risks
* Learn & optimize process and tool chains earlier
* Optimize fixing incidents
* Rollbacks are more manageable

#### Automation

* Reproducible process that ensures repeatibility
* Facilitate rapid iterative development
* Gain fast feedback
* Humans more important
* Consequences and pitfalls of automation
	* Law of marginal costs (more automation means more complex system)
	* Verb/noun mistake (processes vs artifacts)
	* Paradox of Automation (human contributions becomes more critical)
