## Intro to DevOps

### What is DevOps

* DevOps Culture
	* Discipline
	* Conventions
	* Defined transparent process
* Formal Definition

### What is not DevOps

* Operations experts taking over Development
* Developers taking over Operations
* Not a new department or role profile
* No one-size-fits-all solution
* No new tools

### Why DevOps

* Conflict
* Streamline delivery process, emphasizing learning
* Higher-quality software, more aligned with requirements

### How DevOps helps

* Close gaps
* Focus on harder problems
* Holistic delivery process, faster and better

### Team Settings

#### Traditional

* Hero cult
* Emphasis on titles
* Shaodw responsibilities
* Favor a plan over planning
* Operations accompanies and accounts for 'the last mile'
* Cultural barriers
	* Separated teams
	* No common languages
	* Fear

#### Agile

* One team approach
* Operations often acts or gets treated as a silo
	* Tasked with deliverables
	* Outside of Agile frameworks
	* Often receives non-functional requirement after Development
* Blame game
* Obstacles to collaboration, processes and tools that are built up in front of Operations.
* Operations perceived as bottleneck.
* High-frequency of software only on development

#### Team

* One team approach includes experts from Operations
	* Automation scripts
	* Infrastructure as Code
* Shared goals and values, collective ownership
* Allignment of incentives, processes and tools.
* Collaborative problem-solving approach.

### Building blocks of DevOps

#### Measurements and Metrics

* You can only improve if you measure
* Traditional approach
* Agile approach

#### Improve Flow of Features

* Fast feedback (from inception to availability)
* Decreasing risk of releases through a holistic approach
* Reduce batch size without changing capacity

#### Improve and Accelerate Delivery

* Small releases over big releases
* Deploy frequently, reduce risks
* Learn & optimize process and tool chains earlier
* Optimize fixing incidents
* Rollbacks are more manageable

#### Automation

* Reproducible process that ensures repeatibility
* Facilitate rapid iterative development
* Gain fast feedback
* Humans more important
* Consequences and pitfalls of automation
	* Law of marginal costs (more automation means more complex system)
	* Verb/noun mistake (processes vs artifacts)
	* Paradox of Automation (human contributions becomes more critical)
